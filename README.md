- Two independent iterations of the effect working simultaneously, with the aim of creating innovative sounds, allowing the user to mix and pan each of these iterations independently. By default, the plugin will work in intervals of one bar, but the user will have up to eight different possibilities.
- Filter the audio output of the plugin, in order to delete the low or high frequencies of the effect from the signal without the need to use other equalisation plugins.
- With the general control panel, the user will be able to fine-tune the various aspects of the generated output. This panel will include:
   - Transition controller between sections, whose function will be to smooth or accentuate the transition between one application interval and the next.
   - A mixer that allows the incoming sound to be combined in real time with the resulting sound, generating an output that will be the result of both.
   - Gain controller, so that the user can adjust the output volume if it is too high.
